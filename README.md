# üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Playground ‚Äì Scripts Repository

Welcome to the **DevOps Playground Scripts Repo** ‚Äî a central place for all reusable scripts, automation helpers, and command-line tools used across our infrastructure, CI/CD, and containerization projects.

---

## üìÅ Structure

All scripts are organized by topic or purpose in subdirectories:

```

scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra/                  # Infrastructure-related scripts (Terraform, AWS CLI, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cicd/                   # CI/CD helper scripts (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ containers/             # Docker/Kubernetes/Helm related scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ansible/                # Ansible playbooks and patching automation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring/             # Prometheus, Grafana setups
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                  # Misc utilities and helper tools

## üöÄ Getting Started

> These scripts are meant to be used as modular helpers for larger workflows, not full applications.
